## Installation  

### Step 1: Clone this Repository  
First, clone this repository to your local machine:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahiprime2001/ai-tools.git
cd ai-tools
```

### step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you plan to use GPU acceleration, install the appropriate PyTorch version:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### step 3: Download LLaMA 3.2 Model Weights
Download the model weights from the official Meta AI website or authorized distributor. Place them in the models/ directory.

# Example AI
## Running LLaMA 3.2
### Step 1: Start the Model
Run the following command to start the model:

```bash
python run_llama.py --model models/llama-3.2 --task chat
```
### Step 2: Interact with the Model
Type your queries directly into the terminal:

```bash
> What is AI?
LLaMA 3.2: AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
```

##Advanced Options
####Fine-Tuning
Use the fine_tune.py script to adapt the model for specific datasets:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --model models/llama-3.2 --data custom_dataset.json
```
##Performance Optimization
-**Use GPU acceleration for faster inference.
-**Adjust settings like batch size and sequence length in the config.json file for better performance.
